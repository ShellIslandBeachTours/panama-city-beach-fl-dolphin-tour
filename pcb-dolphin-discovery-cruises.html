They are the most abundant of flipper friends found off Laguna Beach.

<div> <p>St. Andrew Bay dolphins can be seen at any time of the year, but it is difficult to predict their behavior. Dolphin behavior is affected by many factors, including the weather conditions, tide cycles, water temperatures, tides, availability of prey, and other environmental factors. There is a good chance to see dolphins whenever the sun is shining and the waters are clear. Feeding activities usually take place on an outgoing tide. Panama Beach Dolphin Tours is a great option. They are on the water almost every day of year.</p><p>Florida law forbids dolphin swimming and feeding. The Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission has officers on the water to enforce these rules. You may have the opportunity to see dolphins from your boat, which will give you a great view and great photos. <i>Humidity</i>  You can have wild dolphin encounters with dolphins by taking one of our Shell Island Snorkel Tours. Dolphins often swim close to snorkelers.</p><p>The killer whales are not only found in colder areas, but they have also been seen in warmer water areas like Florida, Hawaii, Australia and the Galapagos Islands.</p></div>

<div> <p>A dolphin tour is one the most popular activities in PCB. <i>Binoculars</i>  One of the many outfitters in the area will arrange a sightseeing tour for you, which can be either a morning or evening. It will take you to St. Andrews Bay and Shell Island. The watercraft doesn't necessarily have to be stayed on. To make the most of the Gulf Coast's natural beauty, you can add snorkeling time onto your itinerary.</p><p>Sea water is an effective disinfectant but interaction with wild dolphins could lead to disease transmission. These can pose serious health risks to both dolphins and humans. Swimming with dolphins is considered harassment and you don't want to be fined.</p><p>Pier Park is one of the best places to stay in Panama City Beach. Long Beach. Lower Grand Lagoon. Laguna Beach.
