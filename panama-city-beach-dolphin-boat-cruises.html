"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Dolphinaria might have you believe that dolphins are not apex predators of the ocean. They can kill sharks and should be treated accordingly. The aggressive nature of dolphins can make them dangerous to humans, other dolphins and even cause self-harm. The majority of dolphins found in the United States are kept in captivity. However, they are not domesticated."

<div> <p>We will get you in the water before they arrive. This will make it more likely that the dolphins swim to us, rather than to us. Shell Island Beach Tours is smaller than larger boats, which can carry as many as 150 people. You can be in the water quickly with your snorkel gear on without any disruptions or splashing that large groups often cause, which can sometimes scare the dolphins away. <b>Accomplishment</b>  For larger groups of up to 30 people, we have five identical boats. We limit the number to six per boat. A new Large Family Shell Island Beach Tours is available for up to 13 people. No pets are allowed on the boats.</p><p>Some dolphins living in coastal areas at higher latitudes have a tendency to migrate south during the winter. The Atlantic side of the U.S. has coastal bottlenose dolphins that migrate seasonally between New Jersey (N. Carolina) and New Jersey (B.).</p><p>You can also enjoy a variety of outdoor activities such as swimming, kayaking, snorkeling and golf. Perhaps the most exciting thing about Destin is to make a short trip to Gulf World and swim alongside the dolphins.</p> <b>Moonlight</b></div>

<div><p>Shell Island, St Andrews Bay, & the Gulf of Mexico offers something new and exciting every time you visit. The island's grass flats and shallows are great for snorkeling with the whole family. You can choose from either a small group or a personal tour for a custom wildlife adventure.<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach Dolphin Boat Cruises - Humidity</h2><ul><li>Accomplishment</li><li>Enjoyment</li><li>Seaside</li><li>Learning</li><li>Dolphins</li><li>Delight</li><li>Fish</li><li>Beverage</li><li>Tranquil</li><li>Restful</li><li>Contentment</li><li>Sunshine</li><li>Voyage</li></ul> This tour has everything! We have been doing this for more than 30+ years and are EXPERTS in family fun.</p><p>Dolphins are a loose grouping of different aquatic mammals that live all over the world. In Florida, the most common dolphin is the bottlenose dolphin. The iconic grey dolphin that Shell Island Beach Tours made famous. For many years, Americans were used to see dolphins perform tricks for fish at various marine attractions around the country. But in recent years, more protections have been put in place around wild dolphins.</p><p>Florida law prohibits dolphins from swimming or touching them. This is to ensure their well-being. Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission officers are present on the water to enforce the rules. If you are lucky enough to encounter dolphins, they may approach your tour boat very close, providing you with a fantastic view and great photo opportunity. Shell Island Snorkel Tours are a great option if you want to see wild dolphins in the sea. The dolphins can sometimes swim right next to snorkelers.</p></div>
