<div><p>There are many species of dolphins that can be found in Panama City Beach. <i>Humidity</i>  However, the most common and well-known dolphins are the bottlenose dolphins.</p><p>Private charters may be booked for up to eight hours and can accommodate up to six guests. Public tours are typically three hours long. Blue Dolphin Tours provides a public (two hours) and a private tour (two to four hours). Most boats can accommodate up to six guests. The large family Blue Dolphin cruise can fit 15. Local outfitters typically provide snorkeling gear on excursions. Large groups may enjoy the bright-yellow, 73-foot Sea Screamer, offering day and sunset cruises. Each two-hour tour includes a 10-mile ride along the coast and dolphin sightseeing. If you’re bringing kids along, they may get a chance to help the captain steer the boat.</p><p>A dolphin cruise is one of the top activities in PCB. You can choose one of the many local outfitters before you set out on a daytime tour or an evening sightseeing tour. This will allow you to explore St. Andrews Bay, Shell Island and the clear waters surrounding it. You don’t have to stay in the watercraft. A few excursions add snorkeling time for an unforgettable Gulf Coast experience.</p></div>

<div><p>Swim with Dolphins at Panama City Beach and Dolphin Encounter will allow you to get up close to these intelligent animals. You can swim with them and give them a hug.</p><p>Panama City Beach and Bay County offer amazing snorkeling and swimming spots, other than the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>Provisioned dolphins can be bribed with fish in order to interact with people. They are not socially connected like the single dolphin. Instead, they will only be interested in receiving free food. <b>Narrative</b>  They are friendly and curious, according to many visitors. Aggression is still a problem.</p></div>

<div> <p>Dolphins are not able to swim with humans, "kiss" others or tow people through water because they want to. <b>Binoculars</b>  Instead, they do it because the need to. All of these behaviors are not natural and dolphins in captivity are taught to do them correctly.</p><p>Both locals and tourists can join us on dolphin tours to Panama City Beach. It is our number one priority to ensure that the dolphins do not get disturbed during their day. We're familiar with all the areas where schools of dolphins congregate. We'll take us all over the Gulf of Mexico so you can view these majestic dolphins in their natural environment.</p><p>Which is the Best Time to Visit Dolphins in Florida Dolphins are most common from late May through early August. <b>Seaside</b>  The best time to spot dolphins is between 10 a.m. - noon, and then from 2:45 p.m. - until it gets dark.</p> </div>
