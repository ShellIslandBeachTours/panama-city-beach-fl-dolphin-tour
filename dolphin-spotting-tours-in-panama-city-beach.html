<div><p>There are many warm-water vacation spots where you can swim with dolphins, such as Hawaii, Mexico and Florida. Costs: A basic shallow-water interaction[1] will cost you between $80-$145 depending on where you are staying and how the dolphins behave.</p><p>Do not touch dolphins. If the dolphins would like to touch you, they'll do it.<br><br><h2>Dolphin spotting tours in Panama City Beach - Binoculars</h2><ol><li>Map</li><li>Excitement</li><li>Serene</li><li>Moonlight</li><li>Humidity</li><li>Accomplishment</li><li>Enjoyment</li><li>Seaside</li><li>Learning</li><li>Dolphins</li></ol> You can touch only one dolphin at a time, and all other dolphins will flee the area. This can negatively impact dolphin behavior and cause irritation among other people in your group.</p><p>October Panama City Beach's clearest period of the year begins on September 13 and lasts approximately 9.0 months. <b>Enjoyment</b>  June 12 is also a good time. October is Panama City Beach’s clearest and most sunny month. The sky is usually clear, mostly, or partly clear for 64% of its time.</p></div>

<div> <p>Dolphins are able to breathe through their blowhole located on the top portion of their head. The interesting thing about dolphins is that they can still experience respiratory irritation. It could result in the equivalent to someone coughing or sneezing. The dolphins' coughing experience is called "chuffing".</p><p>The wildest dolphins will bite when they're angry, frustrated or afraid. They will bite if they see people swimming with them. Dolphins who have become career hustlers can be aggressive, pushy and threatening if the handouts they aren't getting are not forthcoming.</p><p>By becoming a floating object, you can attract dolphins. <i>Excitement</i>  You sweeten the waters by adding chunks of pilchards or Spanish sardines to your water. It's an efficient way to score points, while also allowing you to chat with friends and enjoy some tunes.</p></div>
