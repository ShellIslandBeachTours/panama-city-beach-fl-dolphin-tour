<div> <p>"We had an amazing time!" Captain Dave was great and took us to a spot where dolphins can often be seen. And we were fortunate enough to be able to swim with dolphins, snorkel with them, as well as see them. It was an unforgettable adventure that I have added to my bucket-list. I would highly recommend Shell Island Beach Tours.</p><p>Although you may have seen dolphins in captivity in a marine park or aquarium, it is much more fascinating to see these magnificent animals in their natural habitat. <b>Map</b>  Even though wild dolphin behavior cannot be predicted, and sightings on all trips are not guaranteed, tour captains have a lot of experience on the waters of St. Andrew Bay almost every day. Our captains know where dolphins can be found, and they do everything possible to ensure guests have a good time. Dolphins can be seen on most tours jumping, playing, looking for food and communicating with each other.</p><p>The dolphins of St. Andrew Bay are wild animals, so it is impossible to predict the best time to see them. Dolphin behavior is influenced by the season, weather conditions, water temperatures, tide cycles, and availability of prey among many other factors. Generally, there is a good chance of seeing dolphins any time the sun is out and the water is calm and clear. Feeding activities are normally seen on an outgoing tide. Your best bet is to choose a dolphin tour operator like Panama Beach Dolphin Tours that is on the water nearly every day of the year.</p></div>

The most common dolphin found in Florida is the bottlenose. Shell Island Beach Tours created the iconic grey dolphin. Americans have enjoyed seeing dolphins tricks for fish for many decades at marine attractions all over the country. However, wild dolphins are now protected by more safeguards.</p></div>

You may see dolphins jumping, searching for food and communicating among themselves on many tours.</p><p>“This was the most amazing experience. The captain was great. We snorkeled, searched for shells, and even swam with the dolphins! We saw so many sea creatures. Highlight of our trip!”</p></div>
